# Forum Topics

## Docs and new solutions for it

Cameron, Ryan - It might be easier to port docs to a new system. Wiki style docs make sense for documentation. Want to find a new docs system the supports markdown. Port as much relevant data and remove the old stuff. 

Here are the examples
- foswiki.org
- moinmo.in
- xwiki.org

Templating is an eromously useful tool that the current docs does very well.

Next Week we will vote.

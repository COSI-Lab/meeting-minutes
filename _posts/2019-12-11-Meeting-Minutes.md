## Beasty's Motherboard

Fortran - RIP, Beast machine is "working". 1 of 4 RAM slots are working and only 2 of 3 of graphics cards + ethernet can work at once. x^6 + x^2 + x... There are 2 primary options, replacing the motherboard and cpu on beasty or salvaging parts and adding them to the corner lab machines that never get used. 

We're going to give merging machines together first before buying something new.

## M E T E R S T I C K

Grm - We have a few measuring sticks. Our meter stick has been broken since 2014 and grm would like if we got a new one. We're grabbing from the hardware store.

## LED Strips?

Manthony - All of the blinds have little space for LED spaces, with 3 R-PIs we can control all of the blinds. Long story short we're doing it! Next semester we'll buy them.

## MAC-MINI

Tim Apple - Athena the new MAC-MINI is here.
*We need an apple id*
We're going to make a new apple id and talk to jeanna about the email
*We have 2 monitors using Thomas' adapter*
We're going to get a thunderbolt 3 to HDMI adapter. As well as getting a KVM or 2 so we can use both machines at the same station. Next semester we'll get pricing.
*Getting a magic track pad*
External mousepad would be reeeeally nice but a little pricey. It's added to the queue for next semester. 

## missing chalk reeeeee (and new Hagaromo)

(elt j t) - THE HAGAROMO IS MISSING! Plz report if found. If we don't find it and we'll buy new chalk next semester. We should get new verisons of the Hagaromo or old stuff? It sounds like we're getting the new stuff that isn't a part of math and cs history.

## GPU Server

(list-ref h js) - Bringing back up GPU Server brought up at the last meeting. The cheapest is $4900 and our budget is $6550... It's going to require some kind of sugar daddy grant or it's going to have to wait.  

## I demand moar power over talks/

Christopher Mahoney - Next semester when talks gets rewritten I would like more features and less vulnerabilties.

## No 1-15P NEMA @COLO

tj - The phone couldn't be plugged in at COLO because the wires are all wrong... We'd like to make a new plug but first we're going to ask the COLO people how to get a connection. EMAIL BRAIN!

To do a machine learning project you have to become a data janitor so Josh got all the legislators twitter handles. Josh used a python lib to get all the data.

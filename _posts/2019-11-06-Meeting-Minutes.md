## Social media alternatives

Jeanna - We all have social media. Facebook allows false and misleading claims to be advertised while twitter has banded all political ads. Jeanna doesn't believe that free speach protects the right to _amplification_ of speach. There are rules against of amplification, for example the fcc has broadcasting rules. The issue is social media hasn't caught up yet. Jeanna has deleted the facebook app from her phone and she's started using facebook less. Mastidon is an alternative and the are many things built on GNU social.

## CNY

Ryan - Cameron and Rany attended the CNY hackathon. They have food but no rooms and you need your own ride. A group of l33t h@ck3rs are trying to hack your network (that they created for you).

At the CNY hackathon your team is chosen for you. You can join in April!

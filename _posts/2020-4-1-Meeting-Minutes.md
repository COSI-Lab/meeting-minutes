# Cruel April Fools Joke

Hunter - I accidently lost the minutes for this week, hopefully it won't happen again with :/.

# Some kind of recap...

Hunter - From my fleeting memory we choose next weeks talks password (which I have to update still), we used jitsi for the meeting, jsh is trying to write a red black tree in rust, Jeanna told us stories from past COSI April Fools and we talked about all the problems with zoom.

# OH!

OH - AND 7 HOUR ROUGE LIKE THIS SUNDAY. B THERE OR B ^2
